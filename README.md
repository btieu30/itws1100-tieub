This is my repository with all my coursework for ITWS-1100.

### Lab 3: Personal Website
I thought this lab was fun! I enjoyed making a website as
I haven't played around with web development in a while
and it felt nice to have my designs from the site map
come to life. I removed all the basic CSS styling that comes with the HTML elements because I think it removed another level of complexity. I also took inspiration from many sites where the contact section acts as the header and used icons for a cleaner look. I also made sure to pick images for the icons that were consistent in terms of color and shape to make the site more appealing. Lastly, I chose to use a card layout for the labs instead of having a bulleted list so that it be more appealing for users and I thought this would be the best way to display a small description for each lab so users are aware what they are clicking into.

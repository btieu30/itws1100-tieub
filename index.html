        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Brianna Tieu and I am a Computer Science and ITWS student
            at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. As a computer science student, I am
            always interested in learning more about new technologies and programming,
            but I also love playing video games, listening to music, and spending time
            with my loved ones during my free time. Check out my spotify playlist below
            to get a feel for my music taste! I am looking to branch out of the
            computer science world and learn more about ITWS in this class. I am excited
            to learn more about the field and if this is something I would be interested
            in pursuing in the future. This website is a collection of my course labs and projects. 
            The purpose of this site is to document my progress throughout the semester. I am 
            excited to learn more about the major of ITWS in this class! I am also looking forward 
            to building this website and improving my web development skills.

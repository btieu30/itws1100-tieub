        <h1>Lab 3: Build Your Personal Website</h1>
        <p>
          The goal of this lab was to create this site! We were 
          supposed to design and build a website to hold our work
          for this class with a required landing page, labs
          landing page, and a page for each lab completed so far.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          First, we were told to develop site maps to give us an
          idea of how we wanted the structure to be. Then, I used
          the site map to create a basic skeleton of the pages and 
          referenced the rubric to ensure I was meeting all the 
          requirements and had to proper repository structure. After 
          that, I filled in the contents of the pages and added styling. 
          I developed a landing page, labs landing page, and a page for 
          each lab so far. I also made sure to push to GitHub and 
          pull from the VM to check that the structure of my site was 
          correct and that the pages were working as expected.

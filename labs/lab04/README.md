### Lab 4: RSS and Atom Feeds
I thought this lab was interesting, as I never played
around with XML before and this was actually my time 
using it! I found XML syntax to be interesting 
and straight-forward, as it is similar to HTML. But,
the dates were giving me trouble as I used the wrong weekday for one of the dates and I was wondering why 
my feed was invalid. After a few minutes of debugging,
I realized my mistake and was able to get both feeds to
validate immediately.
